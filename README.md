# Bank-Loan-Report-Dashboard

With great pleasure, I complete my most recent work, the Bank Loan Report (SUMMARY/REPORT), which was meticulously created with the Excel program. 

The Summary and Overview dynamic dashboards are the two that make up this project. A thorough summary of important indicators, such as the total number of loan applications, funded and received amounts, average interest rates, and average debt-to-income ratios, is provided by the Summary Dashboard. Additionally, it offers comparisons from month to month and month to date. The use of a donut chart, for example, clearly shows how the "GOOD LOAN" and "BAD LOAN" categories are distributed, while a bar chart clearly shows the dashboard's overall state. 

Deeper data analysis is provided by the second dashboard, Overview, which shows monthly total loan applications via a line chart, state-by-state regional analysis
